        To ensure the maximum accessibility for spinner components it is
        recommended you provide a relevant ARIA role property, and include
        screenreader-only readable text representation of the spinner's meaning
        inside the component using Bootstrap's visually-hidden class. The
        example below provides an example of accessible usage of this component.
